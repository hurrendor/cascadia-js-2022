## Abstract

The future is here! We can now model an entire system front to back with pure functions. Come to this talk to learn about applying functional programming concepts to the cloud, and the browser.

## Notes

- dependencies breaking is bad
- browsers broke stuff all the time back in the day
- additive changes help with not breaking things
  - http1 -> http2
  - xml http request -> fetch
  - async/await
  - `<script type="module"></script>`
  - woff -> woff2
  - s3.listobjectsv2
- lots of moving parts
- can we simplify?
- yes [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement)
  - good for accessibility and also help with dependencies
- framework are incorporating this
  - [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [remix](https://remix.run/), [astro](https://astro.build/)

- demo with enhance.dev
  - api routes
  - its kind of like php, not a bad thing
- recap
  - file based routing with plain html
  - reuse markup wtih custom elements
